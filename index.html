					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Desk of The Director of Studies.<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education chastens vice, it guides virtue, it gives at once,grace and government to the genius. A man without education is a splendid slave and a reasoning savage.<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE ZENITH EDU-CONSULT, born out of the zeal, passion, love and determination to impart knowledge into children and wards as a destiny builder and future enhancer, towards giving back future and the tomorrow of hope, assurance and positive expectations.
Almost 3 decades of relentless and selfless efforts, the academy which originally began as ADMIRAL PRIVATE SCHOOL in Agege Area of Lagos State and extended to some parts of Ogun Stare, with the hope of getting across the country and beyond, has touched hundreds, if not thousands of pupils and students, among those who are doing well home and abroad.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No nation grows above learning, and the nation’s prosperity is not measured in the abundance of wealth and resources but in its developed men and women in education, intelligence and character. We see this as a key factor and in order not to alienate anyone with his destiny, we picked education as springboard for development and excellence.
We catch them young.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our services run through cradle to the limit anyone can think of, because education is that phenomenon that has written its frame, “Cradle to Grave”.    
You will enjoy us for effective Tutorials for Junior and Senior Secondary School Classes. We are experts in JAMB, WAEC, NECO, JCE, POST UTME and other internal and external examination with outstanding results.
Join us for more information.<br><br> We are the Primus Inter Pares!!!<br><br>
